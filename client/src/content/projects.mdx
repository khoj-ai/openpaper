## Research, Bundled

With Projects, you can now group multiple papers together to create a research bundle. Think of it as a curated collection of papers on a specific topic, project, or area of interest. This allows you to keep your research organized and easily accessible.

### Supercharge Your Literature Review

Conducting a thorough literature review is the foundation of any great research project, but it often involves juggling dozens of PDFs, trying to connect disparate ideas, and meticulously tracking sources. Projects are designed to streamline this entire process:

- **Simplified Synthesis:** Instead of manually comparing papers, you can ask the Project chat to answer complex questions. Pose questions like, "What are the main disagreements between these authors?" or "Summarize the evolution of this concept across these papers." The AI synthesizes information from all the bundled papers, helping you see the bigger picture in seconds.
- **Stay Organized:** Forget sprawling folders of PDFs with cryptic names. A Project acts as a single, coherent workspace for each of your research threads. This focus helps you move faster and avoid the chaos of a disorganized reference library.
- **Write with Confidence:** With grounded citations that link directly to the source, you can draft your review with greater accuracy and speed. No more hunting for that one specific quote or statistic; it's always just a click away.

#### Why use AI for Literature Reviews?

You should know how to review literature and synthesize it yourself, for starters. Before using AI to automate any task, it's important to always have a robust understanding from first principles of how you would tackle it yourself.

Once you've mastered the fundamentals, AI can be a powerful tool to enhance your efficiency and depth of understanding. It can help you identify connections between papers that you might have missed, summarize large volumes of information quickly, and provide diverse perspectives on complex topics. By leveraging AI in your literature reviews, you can focus more on critical analysis and synthesis, ultimately leading to richer insights and more robust research outcomes.

### Feature Walkthrough

1. Chat with Your Entire Project

Once you've created a Project, you can chat with all the papers in it at once. Our AI-powered chat will read from each of the papers in your Project to provide you with comprehensive and relevant answers.

2. Grounded Citations, In-Flow

As you chat with your Project, you'll get grounded citations that you can review in-flow. This means you can easily see which paper a particular piece of information came from, and you can click on the citation to jump directly to the relevant section of the paper.

3.  Custom Podcasts for Your Projects

In addition to chatting with your papers, you can also create custom podcasts for your Projects. This is a great way to get a summary of your research on the go.

#### Coming Soon: Charts and Graphs

We're just getting started with Projects. Soon, you'll be able to create charts and graphs from the data in your Projects, giving you even more ways to visualize and understand your research.

We're excited to see how you use Projects to supercharge your research. As always, we'd love to hear your feedback!
