Today we're launching Open Paper v0.1, a research application designed to transform how researchers interact with scholarly literature. We're building Open Paper to address the challenges researchers face when working with academic papers, from organization to comprehension to collaboration. This is a tool that aims to be your AI-native paper-reading research assistant, helping you navigate the complexities of academic literature with ease.

## A Central Hub for Your Research

As researchers, you may often find ourselves juggling dozens of PDFs across multiple folders, struggling to locate that perfect citation when we need it most. Open Paper solves this by providing a single home for all your research papers.

You can upload your entire collection, search across all documents simultaneously, and easily build citations when writing your own work. The split-pane design keeps the paper you're reading at the center of your attention while providing tools that complement rather than distract from your reading experience.

This means less time hunting for information and more time engaging with the content that matters to your research.

## Seamless Annotation System

Taking notes while reading papers is essential, but traditional methods often separate the notes from the source material. Open Paper brings these together with an integrated annotation system.

Make all your highlights and annotations in one simple view, directly alongside the paper. When you discover something worth sharing, you can easily send your annotated paper to colleagues, complete with all your insights and highlights intact.

This streamlines collaboration and ensures that important observations remain connected to their source, creating a more cohesive research experience.

## Intelligent Inline Menu

Context switching is the enemy of deep work. That's why we've created an intelligent inline menu that appears whenever you highlight text in the PDF reader.

This menu allows you to instantly add selections to your chat with the AI, create annotations, or save important quotes—all without disrupting your reading flow. By keeping tools accessible exactly when and where you need them, you can maintain focus on understanding the material rather than managing your workspace.

## Trustworthy AI Chat with Context Linking

AI can be a powerful research assistant, but only if you can verify its claims. Open Paper's chat functionality is built with transparency at its core.

Every AI response includes citations that link back to the original paper, allowing you to jump directly to the source material with a single click. This means you can quickly verify information and dive deeper into topics of interest without having to search manually through the document.

This approach transforms AI from a black box into a transparent research partner that enhances your understanding rather than obscuring the source of information.

## Paper Finder Tool

Research doesn't happen in isolation. Open Paper includes a Paper Finder tool that connects you to a public database of academic papers, helping you discover related research that might inform your work.

This feature helps bridge the gap between your current focus and the broader academic conversation, ensuring you don't miss important connections or recent developments in your field.

## AI as a Copilot, Not a Replacement

We believe the most effective ways to use AI are as a graceful copilot—assisting with verification and information retrieval rather than attempting to replace human thought. If we want to accelerate our ability to learn and do meaningful work, we still need to make the effort of reading and understanding ourselves.

Open Paper is designed with this philosophy in mind. Our tools aim to enhance your natural research workflow, providing assistance when needed while keeping you firmly in control of the research process. Delightful and effective experiences that integrate AI should use them as guides and nudges, rather than encouraging them to replace novel thought.

## Join the Open Paper Community

Open Paper v0.1 is just the beginning. We're committed to building tools that respect the research process while making it more efficient and enjoyable. We invite you to try Open Paper, share your feedback, and help us shape the future of AI-assisted research.
