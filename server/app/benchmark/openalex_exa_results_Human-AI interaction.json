    "text": "The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has given rise to the field of Human-AI Interaction (HAII). This study meticulously reviewed the research themes, theoretical foundations, and methodological frameworks of the HAII field, aiming to construct a comprehensive overview of this field and provide robust support for future investigations. HAII research themes include human-AI collaboration, competition, conflict, and symbiosis. Theories drawn from communication, psychology, and sociology support these studies, while the employed methods include both self-reporting and observational approaches commonly utilized in user studies. It is suggested that future research should broaden its focus to encompass diverse user groups, AI roles, and tasks. Moreover, it is necessary to develop multi-disciplinary theories and integrate multi-level research methods to support the sustained development of the field. This study not only furnishes indispensable theoretical and practical insights for forthcoming research endeavors but also catalyzes the realization of a future distinguished by seamless interaction between humans and AI.",

    "text": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) frame opportunities and challenges for user interface design. Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of human-AI interaction design principles.",

    "text": "AI systems are increasingly being adopted across various domains and application areas. With this surge, there is a growing research focus and societal concern for actively involving humans in developing, operating, and adopting these systems. Despite this concern, most existing literature on AI and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) primarily focuses on explaining how AI systems operate and, at times, allowing users to contest AI decisions. Existing studies often overlook more impactful forms of user interaction with AI systems, such as giving users agency beyond contestability and enabling them to adapt and even co-design the AI's internal mechanics. In this survey, we aim to bridge this gap by reviewing the state-of-the-art in Human-Centered AI literature, the domain where AI and HCI studies converge, extending past Explainable and Contestable AI, delving into the Interactive AI and beyond. Our analysis contributes to shaping the trajectory of future Interactive AI design and advocates for a more user-centric approach that provides users with greater agency, fostering not only their understanding of AI's workings but also their active engagement in its development and evolution.",

    "text": "As stories of human-AI interactions continue to be highlighted in the news and research platforms, the challenges are becoming more pronounced, including potential risks of overreliance, cognitive offloading, social and emotional manipulation, and the nuanced degradation of human agency and judgment. This paper surveys recent research on these issues through the lens of the psychological triad: cognition, behavior, and emotion. Observations seem to suggest that while AI can substantially enhance memory, creativity, and engagement, it also introduces risks such as diminished critical thinking, skill erosion, and increased anxiety. Emotional outcomes are similarly mixed, with AI systems showing promise for support and stress reduction, but raising concerns about dependency, inappropriate attachments, and ethical oversight. This paper aims to underscore the need for responsible and context-aware AI design, highlighting gaps for longitudinal research and grounded evaluation frameworks to balance benefits with emerging human-centric risks.",
